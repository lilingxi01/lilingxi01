# üëã Hi there! I'm Lingxi Li, ÊùéÂáåÁÜπ. ([CV](https://cv.lingxi.li) / [Resume](https://lingxili.notion.site/Lingxi-s-Resume-8f90dbf191664790814ad6006f51267d))

> **PRONOUNS:** He / Him

üéì - I am currently a Computer Science master student at UMass Amherst. Expected to graduate in May 2024 and planning to be a PhD student in HCI. **Open to any offer or discussion!!**

üî¨ - I am actively doing research in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) field with passionate people at UMass BioNLP group.

üë®‚Äçüíª - I am working part-time as Software Engineer at ECA Solar LLC. There are infinite possibilities right there in ECA and in solar industry.

üåç - Besides from my master program and my works, I have been doing multiple outstanding side-projects (ongoing) like [Ams Date Picker](https://ams.lingxi.li). You are expected to see some of them coming next year.

üåÉ - I extremely enjoy the outdoors especially exploring nature and stargazing. So when tired, I liked to drive my car out to a state park. Nature gives me the power of all-day coding. (**I also take photos for them. You can find it in my instagram!! Link is at the bottom of the page.**)

### üõ∞Ô∏è Here are some memos for you to know more about me:

- Modern Full-Stack Software Engineer (2020 - now), experienced with Next.js (both pages and app dir), React, Postgres, React Native, WebSocket, and much more.

- Apple platform Software Engineer (2020 - now), working mainly with SwiftUI. This is what I love and enjoy to do!

- HCI Student Researcher (2022 - now), focusing on exploring HCI projects with NLP and medical fields.

- Software Architect (2021 - now), solved complex real-world questions like LLM-friendly CoT agent runner written in Python but scaling on TypeScript, and a multi-message conversation architecture served between users and LLMs.

- UX-oriented Software Crafter (2017 - now), concentrating on delivering the best ever experience to all of my projects, work or side.

- ML Software Engineer (2022 - 2023), familiar with PyTorch, Keras, Transformers, Numpy, Pandas, etc.

- I love to build a UI component library dedicately for the use of a company / a set of projects because different use cases have different needs. Full customization with Headless components is almost the best solution in UI library!

- Good at leading team, composing big project into pluggable sub-projects, and re-unite them like creating an art.

### üôà What can I do?

- Programming Languages: JavaScript (almost fully TypeScript), Python, Swift, C, Java, C#, SQL.

- Front-end Frameworks: Next.js, React, SwiftUI (iOS/iPadOS/macOS), pure HTML (with CSS), and more.

- Back-end Frameworks: TypeScript API architectures (like Bun server, tRPC, or simply Express), Django, Flask, FastAPI, Springboot, or any framework that is already working.

- Database: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and a lot of serverless options (PlanetScale, Neon).

- Others: CI/CD, Dockerize, UI/UX Design, native adaptation, 3D model integration, Git, Figma, and Unity.

### üíª What am I currently aiming for? *(What am I learning or doing?)*

- Every startup needs a lot of money. So do mine (in the future).

- Publish my first HCI research paper by the end of 2023. Explore more HCI in NLP and medical fields in the future.

- Make a lot of great user-facing softwares that will be totally free and no-ads.

### üëå What can I do for you or with you?

- Help you grow your business fast and efficiently by designing a state-of-the-art software development stack for you.

- Design and develop a dedicated UI component library (on nearly all programming languages and all platforms) for you that fits totally fantastic with your design language and amazingly scalable.

- Bring a small team up with my outstanding team-leading and collaborating skills in Computer Science and software development.

- Share brainstorming ideas, and make your dream project come true in the most detailed way. **You will love what I create.**
