# üëã Hi there! I'm Lingxi Li, ÊùéÂáåÁÜπ. ([Portfolio](https://lingxi.li/))

> **PRONOUNS:** He / Him

üíº - MTS (full-stack) @ Contextual AI. Interested in production-grade machine learning stuff + human interface engineering (basically design engineering + developer experience).

üî¨ - Check my portfolio (link above) for projects, researches, and publications. I love blending research and engineering -- it is so good to have both in one project.

üåç - I constantly work on side projects that are interesting and can have big impact on people other than me. If you have a good idea, feel free to share with me!

üåÉ - I extremely enjoy the outdoors especially exploring nature and stargazing. So when tired, I liked to drive my car out to a state park. Nature gives me the power of all-day coding. (**I also take photos for them. You can find it in my instagram!! Link is at the bottom of the page.**)

### üõ∞Ô∏è Here are some memos for you to know more about me:

- Full-stack Software Engineer (2020 - now), experienced with React, Next.js (both pages and app dir), Python, SwiftUI, Postgres, Redis, React Native, SSE / Socket, and much more. I love code quality + velocity + team standardization.

- Human Interface Engineer (2022 - now), concentrating on the best blend among UI, UX, and DX. High engineering quality + amazing visualization + extraordinary interactions + simple APIs are the best.

- HCI Student Researcher (2022 - 2024), focusing on exploring HCI projects with NLP + medical fields.

- Emerging Software Architect (2021 - now), solved complex real-world questions like LLM-friendly CoT agent runner written in Python but scaling on TypeScript, and a multi-message conversation architecture served between users and LLMs.

- Machine Learning Engineer (2022 - 2024), using PyTorch, Numpy, Pandas, Transformers.

- I love to build a UI component library dedicately for the use of a company / a set of projects because different use cases have different needs. Full customization with Headless components is almost the best solution in UI library!

- Growing and holding high bar with team. I love composing big project into pluggable sub-projects, and re-unite them like creating a beautiful artwork.

### üôà What can I do?

- Programming Languages: TypeScript, Python, Swift, SQL. Learning Go. Previously used C, Java, C#.

- Front-end Tech: Next.js, React, SwiftUI (iOS/iPadOS/macOS), HTML + CSS, and more.

- Back-end Tech: TypeScript API architectures (I love end-to-end type safety), FastAPI, Flask, or any framework that is already working.

- Database: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and a lot of serverless options (PlanetScale, Neon).

- Others: CI/CD, Docker, UI/UX Design, native adaptation, 3D model integration, Git, Figma, and Unity.

### üíª What am I currently aiming for? *(What am I learning or doing?)*

- Every startup needs people + opportunity. Currently building my network for the future.

- Get my hands dirty on ML stuff. I have fundamental but lack of production-grade experiences. I will do more experiments and I enjoy doing it.

- Build my progress on defining Human Interface Engineering. See you soon.

- Make mini apps when necessary and ship them out for free. I deeply believe that the power of user community is more important than small profit in short-term.

### üëå What can I do for you or with you?

- Help you grow your business fast and efficiently by designing a state-of-the-art software development stack for you.

- Design and develop a dedicated UI component library (on nearly all programming languages and all platforms) for you that fits totally fantastic with your design language and amazingly scalable.

- Bring a small team up with my outstanding team-leading, standardization, and collaborating skills in research experiments and full-stack software dev.

- Share brainstorming ideas, and make your dream project come true in the most detailed way. **You will love what I craft.**
